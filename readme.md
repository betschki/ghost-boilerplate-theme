# Ghost Boilerplate Theme

When I started developing Ghost themes, I was annoyed by re-creating the same file structure over and over again. Other boilerplate or starter themes always had some styling attached, which then needed to be stripped away.

**This repo is literally meant for developers who are looking to skip the file-creation process**. There is no code included in the individual .hbs files.
